      <h1>Color theory for designers: a beginner's guide</h1>

      <h2>
        Learn how to choose the right color combinations and create more
        aesthetically pleasing designs by using the guiding principles of color
        theory.
      </h2>

      <p>
        Color theory definitions vary, but color theory for designers generally
        refers to the practical guidelines of color mixing and principles that
        lead to visually appealing and harmonious color combinations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Familiarizing yourself with the principles of color theory can help you
        with everything from logo creation to web design.
      </p>
      <p>
        To help you learn color theory, we’ve broken it down into the following
        topics:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Vocabulary: from tints to saturation to warmth and more — we’ll cover
          the lingo designers use when talking color
        </li>
        <li>
          Color wheel: a powerful tool for visualizing the relationships between
          colors
        </li>
        <li>
          Color schemes: how to use the color wheel to choose your color schemes
        </li>
        <li>
          Tools and resources: apps and guides to help you master designing with
          color
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why you should care about color theory</h2>
      <p>
        Color theory is a mix of science, psychology, and emotion — making color
        an incredibly powerful aspect of design.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sir Isaac Newton got us started with a basic color wheel based on how
        light reflected a spectrum of colors. Color theory and the color wheel
        have continued to evolve, teaching us more about the science behind why
        certain colors complement each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        And over time, color psychology has influenced design as well. A
        combination of cultural, historical, and emotional elements influence
        how humans feel when they see different colors.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you learn color theory, you arm yourself with the scientific and
        psychological principles that help you evoke emotion and responses from
        your target audience.
      </p>

      <h2>The vocabulary of color</h2>
      <p>
        Before we dive into theory, you’ll need to know the following terms:
      </p>

      <h3>Primary colors</h3>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="img/primary.jpg"
          alt="The three primary colors — magenta, cyan, and yellow — are used to create other colors."
        />
        <figcaption>
          The three primary colors — magenta, cyan, and yellow — are used to
          create other colors.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Primary colors form the basis for all other shades. Humans perceive
        three base colors: magenta, cyan, and yellow. Every other color we see
        consists of a combination of these three colors in varying amounts,
        brightnesses, tints, and shades.
      </p>

      <p>
        Traditionally, we considered red, blue, and yellow to be the primary
        colors, but research has shown that magenta, cyan, and yellow better
        describe our experience of color. If those colors sparked memories of
        printer errors caused by lack of magenta ink, you’re not alone. The CMYK
        color model — cyan, magenta, yellow, key (black) — is a subtractive
        color model based on what’s used in color printing. It’s subtractive
        because it subtracts red, green, and blue hues from white light.
      </p>

      <h3>RGB and hex</h3>
      <figure>
        <img
          src="img/rgb.jpg"
          alt="A chart showing how red, green, and blue are used to create other colors."
        />
        <figcaption>
          Red, green, and blue are used to create other colors.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        On the web, we use RGB (red-green-blue) and hex values to represent
        colors.RGB is an additive color model — colors are created by adding
        colored light to black.
      </p>

      <p>
        The RGB color system defines all colors as a combination of three
        different values: a particular shade of red, another of green, and
        another of blue. So:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>rgb(59, 89, 145) equals Facebook blue</li>
        <li>rgb(0, 0, 0) equals black</li>
        <li>rgb(255, 255, 255) equals white</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The hex color system converts each value to a hexadecimal (base 16)
        representation, like so:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>#3b599b equals Facebook blue</li>
        <li>#000000 equals black</li>
        <li>#ffffff equals white</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Every two characters represents a color value, so for Facebook blue, the
        red hue is 3b, the green is 59, and 9b is blue.
      </p>

      <h3>Hot and cold</h3>
      <figure>
        <img
          src="img/handc.jpg"
          alt="A color wheel showing off cool and warm colors."
        />
        <figcaption>Cool and warm colors</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Colors also have a “warmth,” and each can be classified as either a warm
        or a cool color.
      </p>

      <p>
        Warm colors contain higher amounts of reds and yellows. They can invoke
        a sense of warmth and passion in a design. They can also feel very
        aggressive and bold — that’s why red is often used in error messages.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cool colors contain higher amounts of blue, evoking chilly climates,
        ice, winter, water, nighttime, death, and sadness. They can carry
        connotations of loneliness, coldness, and fear. On the more positive
        side, because cool colors are less aggressive, they can also be soothing
        — think of a blue sky or calming blue waters on a beach
      </p>
      .

      <h3>Color temperature</h3>
      <p>
        Increasing an image’s temperature means increasing its orange levels. It
        generally makes an image look warmer and happier, similar to how the
        world looks happier when the sun casts its orange glow upon it. In
        contrast, reducing an image’s temperature makes it look colder and less
        inviting, like an overcast day.
      </p>

      <h3>Tints and shades</h3>
      <p>
        You add white to a color to create a tint and add black to create a
        shade. Tints and shades let you create monochrome color schemes by
        adding varying levels of white and black to a base color.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, if your base color is #8dbdd8 (a lightish blue) as seen in
        the image below, you can create a monochrome scheme by choosing two
        tints (two brighter blues) and two shades (two darker blues).
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="img/monochrome.jpg"
          alt="Monochrome color scheme based on #8dbdd8 built with COLOURCODE."
        />
        <figcaption>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>Saturation, hue, and lightness</h3>

      <p>
        Saturation describes the intensity of a color. Increasing saturation
        makes the color richer and darker, while reducing saturation makes it
        look faded and lighter. When we say “light blue” or “dark green,” we’re
        describing changes in saturation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hue defines the degree to which a color can be described as similar to
        or different from red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet
        (the colors of the rainbow). So when you describe a color as
        “blue-green,” you’re defining it in terms of two hues.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lightness, also known as value or tone, defines the perceived brightness
        of a color compared to pure white.
      </p>

      <h2>The color wheel.</h2>
      <p>
        A basic color wheel contains the 12 standard colors used to create color
        schemes. Each slice of the pie represents a family of colors that can be
        achieved with different saturations, hues, tints, shades, and mixes of
        neighboring colors. The color combinations (e.g., yellow-orange,
        red-orange) result from mixing equal amounts of the base hues (yellow
        and orange, or red and orange).
      </p>

      <p>
        Red, yellow, and blue are the primary colors. Violet, orange, and green
        are the secondary colors. Everything else is a tertiary color — a mix of
        primary and secondary colors.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Designs use the color wheel to choose one of five types of color
        schemes.
      </h2>

      <h2>5 types of color schemes</h2>
      <p>
        Designers create color schemes by pairing multiple color families from
        the color wheel. This works best when you use one of the following
        patterns that create color harmony.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Monochrome</h3>
      <p>
        A monochromatic color scheme consists of various tints, shades, and
        saturations of a single base color. They’re very cohesive, but run the
        risk of becoming monotonous.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="img/purple-mono.jpg"
          alt="A monochrome color scheme based on purple."
        />
        <figcaption>A monochrome color scheme based on purple.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>2. Complementary</h3>
      <p>
        Complementary color schemes are based on two colors from opposite sides
        of the color wheel. Because the two hues will be wildly different, such
        schemes can be very impactful and noticeable. There is also split
        complementary — where one primary color is used with two analogous
        colors to its complement.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="img/green-red-comp.jpg"
          alt="Complementary color scheme based on shades of green and red."
        />
        <figcaption>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Pro tip: Pick a complementary color for your calls to action. For
        example, if your background color is mint green, a red-violet button
        would catch the eye because it is a complementary color.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="img/mint-violet.jpg"
          alt="Complementary colors mint green and red-violet."
        />
        <figcaption>Complementary colors mint green and red-violet.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>3. Analogous</h3>
      <p>
        Analogous color schemes feature three colors that sit next to each other
        on the color wheel. Because of the tonal similarities, these schemes can
        create a very cohesive, unified feel, without the monotony of a
        monochrome scheme.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Triadic</h3>
      <p>
        To make a triadic color scheme, draw an equilateral triangle (a triangle
        where all three sides are the same length) on the color wheel, and
        select the three colors at the points of the triangle. This triad
        creates a diverse, yet balanced, scheme.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="img/triadic.jpg"
          alt="Triadic color scheme based on purple, beige, and green."
        />
        <figcaption>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>5. Tetradic</h3>
      <p>
        A tetradic color scheme includes four colors that are equidistant from
        each other on the color wheel. Because the four colors can either form a
        square or rectangle, some resources break these color schemes into two —
        square and rectangle.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="img/tetradic.jpg"
          alt="Tetradic color scheme including medium blue, red-purple, spring green, and yellow-green."
        />
        <figcaption>

          and yellow-green.

      </figure>

      <h2>Color palette creation and inspiration</h2>
      <p>
        If you’re feeling overwhelmed, there are plenty of color picker tools
        and palette generators that can provide inspiration. Tools like Colordot
        allow you to start with a main color or a few color choices and then
        create a scheme for you. Meanwhile, tools like Coolors build palettes
        based on the type of color scheme you want.
      </p>

      <h2>Use color theory in your designs</h2>
      <p>
        Color is a powerful tool for evoking emotion and establishing brand
        identity. Think about brands you could recognize by color alone —
        Coca-Cola red or Starbucks green. Color can be so closely tied to a
        brand’s identity that it becomes a legal trademark — like in the case of
        T-Mobile magenta.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether you’re looking for complementary colors for a logo or building
        an entire web design color palette, applying the principles of color
        theory will make your designs more visually impactful. Get out there and
        use your newfound color knowledge to spice up your designs.
      </p>
